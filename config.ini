## Specify how to set the IMAPv4 search criteria (See docs, explanation and examples below)
filter = UNSEEN
## Some simple keywords include:
# - ALL -> No filter, get all mails
# - UNSEEN -> Only get unseen mails
# - SEEN -> Only get seen mails
# - FROM -> Filter by sender address: FROM "some@email.com"
# Chain filter keywords together with the keyword "AND" (e.g. "A AND B") or "OR" (e.g. "OR A B").
# Parenthesis are optional, but may help the filtering

# As an example the following rule as text and as filter:
# Text: only UNSEEN mails and FROM either some@email.com OR FROM some@other-email.com:
# Filter: UNSEEN OR FROM some@email.com FROM some@other-email.com
